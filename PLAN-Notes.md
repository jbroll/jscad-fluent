Yes, a few key considerations before starting implementation:

1. Testing Strategy:
- Consider implementing one complete chain (e.g., FluentGeometry -> FluentBoundedGeometry -> FluentGeom2) with tests before moving to parallel implementations
- The existing test files provide good patterns to follow
- Pay special attention to testing array operations and type conversions

2. Type Safety:
- We need to carefully handle the `RecursiveArray` types that appear in the current code
- Consider adding type guards for safely handling geometry type checks
- May need to review existing JSCAD type definitions for completeness

3. Method Returns:
- Be consistent about when methods return `this` vs new instances
- Transformations modify in place and return `this`
- Operations that create new geometries (like extrude) should return new instances
- Array operations need careful consideration for return types

4. Implementation Order:
1. Base types and interfaces first
2. FluentGeometry with core transforms
3. FluentGeometryArray with array handling
4. One concrete implementation chain (Geom2)
5. Factory functions
6. The other implementation (Geom3)
7. Additional operations and utilities

5. Potential Challenges:
- Array subclassing might have edge cases to consider
- JSCAD's functional API might need some adaptation for our OOP approach
- Type inference with generics could be tricky in some cases

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points before you begin implementation?
